Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lorenz Weise
Maintainer: Lorenz Weise <lorenz-weise@gmx.de>
Description: CREx allows running behavioral experiments from R by controlling visual
    and auditory stimuli and gathering responses under Windows. CREx works by providing
    R-wrapper functions for underlying C-functions, which in turn use the SDL2 C-library
    for controlling graphics, sound and user interaction. Essentially, CREx is a simple
    and limited SDL interface.
